There are pockets of areas you want to steer clear from, but outside of some rough neighborhoods southern California is a beautiful place. I grew up in what is now South Central, which is a very bad place to have to live. 

it might be easier if we knew where you might want to visit and can give recommendations based on that. My favorites were the beaches(many outside of ""LA"", but still part of the southern California community that are fun to see)

There are a lot of clubs that are still around in Hollywood that are where giant bands started their careers.

Many great museums if you are into that. I also always take people up to Griffiths Observatory since it is so common to see in movies and TV. 

if you have more specific things you'd like to see I can be more helpful. Bottom line is its a big area and some places are not safe for tourists to stay in, no matter how cheap the hotel might be.",3,1753758746.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1mc0b3n/los_angeles_advice_needed/n5qac3x/

Check for vintage or flea markets, farmers markets, or food trucks in Abbot Kinney, etc while you’re in town. Walk the beach. Casablanca (restaurant) is a gem for Mexican nearby. 

Cruise up PCH to Malibu if you’re able to!

Santa Monica is just north and Marina Del Ray and Manhattan Beach are south. Cute spots. 

I stayed in West Hollywood (Sunset Blvd.) once but the traffic to get to Venice was wild. I’m from out of state and felt perfectly safe in both areas. West Hollywood is fun, but Venice is better.",2,1753761919.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1mc0b3n/los_angeles_advice_needed/n5qi1l6/

I stayed in an “unsafe” area in LA the whole 3 months I was there and I never felt unsafe tbh but probably because I was with my American partner at the time.

1mc0b3n,n75mje6,1mc0b3n,johnanthonysmillions,"based on your interests, i would definitely aim to stay somewhere in los feliz, silver lake, or echo park. you will then be a short uber ride from all 3 neighborhoods, as well as frogtown, highland park, and dtla. as someone who’s lived on the eastside for 15 years and shares those same interests, this is the move.

i wouldn’t waste your time with hollywood and anywhere west of hollywood.

LA (even public transportation) is actually safe, contrary to what a lot of people claim. some people just don’t feel safe around homeless people. as long as you mind your own business, you’re fine. the amount of homeless people (especially in dtla) can be a culture shock for some.

some fun bar/venues that usually have great music on a nightly basis are zebulon and permanent records roadhouse. you can check out resident advisor if you’re interested in after hours music stuff.
