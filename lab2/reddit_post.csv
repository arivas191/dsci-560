1mc0b3n,travel,Los Angeles advice needed,Separate-Resident-63,"Hello All,

I am 23 and my sister is 22. We will be travelling to LA for 5 nights in late October and need some help.

We are wondering where is a safe area for us to say. I’ve seen a lot of stuff on line saying “I wouldn’t stay there without a man” “ I wouldn’t go out at night alone”. Which makes us quite nervous as it’s just the two of us.

We are both musicians and artists from Melbourne and would love to say in a hip, artistic area. We love gigs, jazz, crafts, nature and walks and would love to stay in a really fun hip area.

If you have any reccomendations please pass them on thank you in advance !! ❤️❤️",1,0.55,21,1753757811.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1mc0b3n/los_angeles_advice_needed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1mc0b3n/los_angeles_advice_needed/
