  "selftext": "Hello All,\n\nI am 23 and my sister is 22. We will be travelling to LA for 5 nights in late October and need some help.\n\nWe are wondering where is a safe area for us to say. I’ve seen a lot of stuff on line saying “I wouldn’t stay there without a man” “ I wouldn’t go out at night alone”. Which makes us quite nervous as it’s just the two of us.\n\nWe are both musicians and artists from Melbourne and would love to say in a hip, artistic area. We love gigs, jazz, crafts, nature and walks and would love to stay in a really fun hip area.\n\nIf you have any reccomendations please pass them on thank you in advance !! ❤️❤️",
